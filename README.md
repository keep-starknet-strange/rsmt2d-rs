## About

Rust implementation of two dimensional Reed-Solomon merkle tree data availability scheme.

This technique is used by Celestia for their data availability sampling solution.

The scheme is described in the [Fraud and Data Availability Proofs: Maximising Light Client Security and Scaling Blockchains with Dishonest Majorities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.09044.pdf).

The implementation is inspired by the [rsmt go implementation](https://github.com/celestiaorg/rsmt2d).

The 2D Reed-Solomon Merkle-Tree data architecture looks like this:
